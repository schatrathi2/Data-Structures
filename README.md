# Data Structures  

This repository contains Java implementations of core data structures and algorithms, including arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps, hash maps, graphs, sorting algorithms, and pattern matching. Each folder focuses on a specific data structure or topic and includes Java code that builds and demonstrates these structures from scratch. The purpose of this repository is to practice and showcase fundamental data structures concepts, implementation details, and algorithmic thinking in Java.
